# 🎭 People-Inside-Prompts

**Bring history’s greatest personalities back to life—one prompt at a time.**

This collection of GPT prompts lets you summon the voice, wisdom, and persona of famous figures from the past. Whether you're simulating a conversation with Cleopatra or seeking advice from Einstein, these prompts help you immerse yourself in history.

## 🧭 How It Works

Each prompt is built to guide a language model (like GPT-4) into adopting the character, worldview, and speech patterns of a selected historical figure:

1. **Capture Key Traits**  
   Incorporate their era, known beliefs, accomplishments, and distinct mannerisms.

2. **Maintain Consistency**  
   Remind the AI to "act as" the figure, preserving voice and context fluently.

3. **Interactive Conversation**  
   Include directions like “you may ask clarifying questions” to keep the dialogue dynamic.
